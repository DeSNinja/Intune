# Intune

This is a work dump of Intune configuration JSON files for many different device types.
I'm an MD-102 Certified technician working on implementing and improving Intune environments, so I created this repository to upload my configuration settings.

A lot of my Windows & MacOS settings are taken from SkipToTheEndpoint's Open Intune Baseline Github repository. I have added on AND removed from the Open Intune Baseline's settings to match MY MSP's needs. This is primarily because the organisations I manage are smaller and require more personalisation and seamless user experience over device lockdown.

I created this repo because I noticed a significant lack of Baseline / Frameworks focusing on MDM policies for iOS, iPadOS and AndroidEnterprise. If I source a policy from another Github, I will usually reference the source in some manner. I'll try and leave as many descriptions as to why I have the policies that I have. They may not be relevant for your organisations, it is your responsibility to choose whether to or not to use the policies I create and upload here.
